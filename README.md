This mod adds quality to food and certain food-related material (e.g. crops)

This does not introduce new items - the quality is based on item tags and should therefor be compatible with most items by default
- There is a whitelist item tag to allow non-food items to gain quality: `quality_food:material_whitelist`, it contains:
  - `#forge:eggs`
  - `#forge:crops`
  - `#forge:dough`
  - `#farmersdelight:wild_crops`
  - `minecraft:sugar`

Quality of items can impact the result of a newly crafted item (if said newly crafted item is applicable to quality)
- the luck stat also improves the chance for (higher) quality
